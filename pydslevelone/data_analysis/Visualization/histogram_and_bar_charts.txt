Histogram and Bar graph

Histogram displays data by way of bars to show the frequency of numerical data. A bar graph representation of data that uses bars to compare different categories of data

A histogram represents the frequency distribution of continuous variables. Conversely, a bar graph is a diagrammatic comparison of discrete variables

Histogram presents numerical data whereas bar graph shows categorical data

The histogram is drawn in such a way that there is no gap between the bars. On the other hand, there is proper spacing between bars in a bar graph that indicates discontinuity

Items of the histogram are numbers, which are categorised together, to represent ranges of data. As opposed to the bar graph, items are considered as individual entities

In the case of a bar graph, it is quite common to rearrange the blocks, from highest to lowest. But with histogram, this cannot be done, as they are shown in the sequences of classes

The width of rectangular blocks in a histogram may or may not be same while the width of the bars in a  bar graph is always same
